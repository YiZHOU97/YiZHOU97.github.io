I'm a third year Ph.D. student from [Department of MAE](https://mae.hkust.edu.hk//), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interest includes construction robot, space robot, robot modeling and control, and motion planning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Molong Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-UxXKzoAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=1381320739207392350) of [MAAL Lab](https://maal.hkust.edu.hk/). 

You can find my CV here: [Yi Zhou's Curriculum Vitae](../files/zhouyiCV.pdf). 

Research Interests
======
My research spans several exciting areas in robotics and automation:

**Boom-lift-mounted Robot (BLMR)**: To advance the automation of high-altitude surface construction tasks, the boom-lift-mounted robot concept is proposed, and the effectiveness is validated through dedicated mechatronic design and a vibration suppression algorithm.

**Bricklaying Robot**: To advance the automation of indoor construction tasks, a bricklaying robot equipped with force-position feedback control is developed and validated through simulations and experiments, demonstrating enhanced placement accuracy and bond strength in the bricklaying process.

**Multi-axis Robotic Additive Manufacturing**: A force-feedback-based closed-loop control framework and helical trajectory generation method for continuous fiber-reinforced polymer  additive manufacturing are porposed to improve printing quality in high-curvature and high-speed scenarios.

**Space Construction Robots**: A space construction robot is developed to autonomously do the construction tasks on the Moon, enabling efficient and precise extraterrestrial infrastructure deployment.

**Motion Planning**: Motion planning and trajectory generation for six-axis robotic arms are developed to achieve high-precision and efficient task execution in complex and dynamic environments, such as artifical potential field method, RRT-Connect, and learning-based method.
