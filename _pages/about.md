I'm a third year Ph.D. student from [Department of MAE](https://mae.hkust.edu.hk//), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interest includes construction robot, space robot, robot modeling and control, and motion planning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Molong Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-UxXKzoAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=1381320739207392350) of [MAAL Lab](https://maal.hkust.edu.hk/). 

You can find my CV here: [Yi Zhou's Curriculum Vitae](../files/zhouyiCV.pdf). 

Research Interests
======
My research spans several exciting areas in robotics and automation:

**Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs)**: I specialize in the modeling, control, and optimization of cable-driven parallel robots, with particular emphasis on reconfigurable systems and disturbance rejection capabilities.

**Robotic Manipulation and Control**: I work on robotic arm modeling and control, including both traditional robotic arms and bio-inspired cable-driven robotic hands. My research covers trajectory planning, system identification, multi-finger coordination control, and real-time compensation methods.

**SLAM and Mobile Robotics**: I develop enhanced localization algorithms that integrate surface feature information into LiDAR SLAM frameworks, significantly improving positioning accuracy in complex environments for mobile robotic inspection systems.

**Additive Manufacturing and Automation**: I have experience in developing real-time monitoring and compensation systems for 3D printing using thermal imaging, achieving significant improvements in print quality and contour accuracy.
